2413 Arkanoid 3

Perhaps it's time to add a constructor to the Arkanoid class.
The constructor must accept two parameters of type int (width and height) and correctly set the values of the corresponding fields of the class.

Requirements:
1. In the Arkanoid class, a public constructor with two parameters of type int must be created.
2. The constructor of the Arkanoid class must correctly set the values of the corresponding fields of the class.
